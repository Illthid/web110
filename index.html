<p>Hello, My name is David. I am working on my degree in database development. I have been in and out of computers since I was young.Over the last 15 years I've been building my own computers. I am 35 years old.
One thing about me is I'm a nerd. A common saying of mine is ‘If its nerdy i have probably done it’. I play tabletop role playing games. I’ve been to lots of conventions. I also ride motorcycles and go to the gym 3 to 4 days a week. I play lots of video games, mostly open world rpgs but love a good strategy game when I can find one.
</p>

<p>I was in the automotive industry for many years. I can fix most things on car, i've a love for 1950-1976 Volkswagens.<strong> I also do my own work on my motorcycles.</strong>
I am always looking for new people to hang out with. My roommates and I have 2 wonderful kittens,<em> Raistlin and Caraman</em> we call them race and car… haha. These wonderful little girls turn 1 year old June 8th..
</p>
